This Project deals with finding out connected components from the input data-\/graphs. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{How it works}}~\newline
 The first algorithm is kosaraju\textquotesingle{}s algorithm which performs 2 graph traversals\+: ~\newline
 Step 1\+: Perform direct dfs from any node and push node to stack {\itshape after{\itshape  dfs finishes on that node ~\newline
 Step 2\+: Perform dfs node present on top of stack, then pop it. each dfs results in a Strongly Connected Component(\+S\+C\+C) ~\newline
